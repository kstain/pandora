# Pandora Dev Environment
This is a portable web app environment (nginx+uwsgi+flask) built with [docker](https://www.docker.com).

## Prerequisites
* Download & install VirtualBox ( [Official](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) &nbsp; [Baidu Pan](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1ntJVGfv) )
* Download & install & run boot2docker ( [Official](http://boot2docker.io/)  &nbsp; [Baidu Pan](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1kTvDpgN) )

## Setup Instruction
For Linux/Mac users, there're some simple scripts written by me; you may simply run those scripts on Linux/Mac. For Windows users, however, you may run those shell scripts at boot2docker.

___You don't have to switch to Linux obligatorily. Just stay in the platform which you are comfortable with, where you're equipped with your familiar IDE or some other tools. That's also one of the benefits of using `docker`.___

### 0. Clone Repositories

```
cd /path/to/your/workplace
git clone git@github.com:BigLeg/pandora.git
git clone git@github.com:BigLeg/cellar.git
git clone git@github.com:BigLeg/sphinx.git
```

### 1. Setup Code Base With Shared Folder

Mount the root of your workplace, which contains `pandora` and `sphinx` (you will clone sphinx soon) as shared folder.

#### 1.1 Replace boot2docker.iso with VirtualBox Guest Additions Built In
The issue is addressed in [this](https://medium.com/boot2docker-lightweight-linux-for-docker/boot2docker-together-with-virtualbox-guest-additions-da1e3ab2465c) blog. If you're so lazy to read it, just follow the instructions bellow. First, download it ( [Official](http://static.dockerfiles.io/boot2docker-v1.2.0-virtualbox-guest-additions-v4.3.14.iso) &nbsp; [Baidu Pan](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1kTvDpgN) ). Path to original `boot2docker.iso` differs in Mac and Windows.

__For Mac users__:

```
mv ~/.boot2docker/boot2docker.iso ~/.boot2docker/boot2docker.ios.old
mv /path/to/newly/downloaded/boot2docker.iso ~/.boot2docker/boot2docker.iso
```

__For Windows users__:

Download the patched boot2docker image [here](http://pan.baidu.com/s/12H8kA)!

Go to install dir and replace the old boot2docker.iso with the patched one. Just copyNpaste!

#### 1.2 Add Shared Folder
Add a machine named `home` (It's important, otherwise you need to manually mount it at boot2docker), whose path points to your workplace. Remember to check "Make Permanent" before click "OK".

#### 1.3 Check Mounting

__For Mac users__:

```
boot2docker ssh
/Users
```
If it responses "Is a directory", it's success. ___NOTE: For whatever workplace you mounted as `home`, it would mount on boot2docker as `/Users`___

__For Windows users__:

Use putty, Xshell whatever and connect to 127.0.0.1 on port 2022.

If the auto-mount is successful, you will see User folder in root dir, i.e. /Users, mounted. ___NOTE: For whatever workplace you mounted as `home`, it would mount on boot2docker as `/Users`___

#### 1.4 Fix symbolic link issue in VirtualBox

The issue and solution is referenced from [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16724543/executing-collectstatic-on-vbox-shared-folder-gives-read-only-error)

__For Mac users__:

```
VBoxManage setextradata VM_NAME VBoxInternal2/SharedFoldersEnableSymlinksCreate/SHARE_NAME 1
```
__For Windows users__:

```
VBoxManage.exe setextradata VM_NAME VBoxInternal2/SharedFoldersEnableSymlinksCreate/SHARE_NAME 1
```
where VM_NAME is the name of your virtual machine (e.g Ubuntu) and SHARE_NAME the name of your shared directory (without the "sf_" prefix).

___!!! You must restart vm after setting this !!!___

### 2. Setup Mysql Container
Refer to [Cellar](https://github.com/BigLeg/cellar)

### 3. Setup This Container

#### 3.1 Customize your names

Look into `build.sh`. You may modify `username` and `image` as you like (see comments).

```
vi build.sh # Modify stuff at build.sh
```

Then build it. This will take a long time, please be patient.

__For Mac users__:

You may either run `build.sh` at local or at boot2docker.

```
./build
```

__For Windows users__:

Run 'build.sh' on boot2docker side. 

```
./build.sh
```

#### 3.2 Setup Ports
Open VirtualBox. Select the vm `boot2docker-vm` (remember to install boot2docker as is instructed at very beginning) --> settings.

<img src="image/vbox-settings.png" width=190/>

Network --> Port Forwarding

<img src="image/settings-network.png" width=260/>

Add these two ports. You may change change the host ports if there's any conflict.

<img src="image/ports.png" width=600/>

#### 3.3 Setup Helper Scripts
I've written two convenient scripts: `serve.sh` and `explore.sh` to run the image.

* `serve.sh` will run a web server container, which maps the ports out so that you can test the newly written python code. Reminder: `Ctrl-C` and re-run `serve.sh` if you change any python code.
* `explore.sh` will take you into the container. Note this container is different than the container above. Web serviced is __NOT__ started in this container. You may do any experiment in it.

___Before running the scripts___, modify `sphinx_root` at `serve.sh` and `explore.sh`, and __They must be in ABSOLUTE path__.

```
vi serve.sh # Modify stuff at serve.sh
vi explore.sh # Modify stuff at explore.sh
```

#### 3.4 Explore Pandora
Now you may explore pandora. Mac users may either run at local or at boot2docker; Windows users must run inside boot2docker;

```
./explore.sh
```

Now you get into the container, with an instance of pandora loaded. ___NOTE: Anything you do to the pandora instance in the container will NOT affect the pandora image built by Dockerfile. This design is intended for sync of environment among all the group members.___ If you must do some customization, remember to commit it using [this](http://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/#commit)

```
docker commit [OPTIONS] CONTAINER [REPOSITORY[:TAG]]
```

#### 3.5 Check Mounting Again
`sphinx` is intended to be mounted into the container after running `explore.sh`. As is done above, we checked mounting at boot2docker, yet at this time, we should check `sphinx` be successfully mounted to the container from boot2docker.

```
# Make sure you have run ./explore.sh and now you're in the container
/opt/sites/sphinx
```

If you receive "Is a directory", then it's success.

If not, please go back and check everything again, carefully.

## 4. Test
Run the server by `serve.sh`, open your browser, and go to http://localhost:9090/test/ping . If you see "pong", everything is done!

```
./serve.sh
```

__Cheers!__
